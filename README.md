# 🧹 Denoising and Signal Enhancement Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to **denoising, filtering, and signal/image enhancement** tasks.  
The notebook provides both theoretical explanations and hands-on implementations, making it useful for **students, researchers, and practitioners** working with noisy datasets.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Noise Simulation**
  - Add synthetic noise (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, etc.) to signals/images.
  - Compare the effects of different noise models.

- **Denoising Methods**
  - Classical filtering (moving average, Gaussian smoothing, Wiener filter).
  - Frequency-domain approaches (FFT-based noise suppression).
  - Advanced denoising (wavelet transform, sparse representations).

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement.
  - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
  - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for images.

- **Visualization**
  - Before vs. after denoising comparisons.
  - Frequency spectrum analysis.
  - Interactive plots for better understanding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
The notebook mainly uses **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **scikit-image**. To install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` is missing, simply open the notebook and install missing packages via `pip` inside the environment.)*

### 3. Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook 48876668-7321-43be-8d2f-0b935ee7b640.ipynb
```
